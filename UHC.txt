RAJAT KASHYAP: Hi Liz
Liz M.: Good Afternoon!
Liz M.: How are you doing today?
RAJAT KASHYAP: good afternoon
RAJAT KASHYAP: Doing good, thanks... and you?
RAJAT KASHYAP: I have questions on the claims that I see online
Liz M.: I am fine, thank you for asking.
RAJAT KASHYAP: first of all.. claim on 01/06/2017 for $75 billed
Liz M.: Sure, I will certainly help you with this information.
RAJAT KASHYAP: I have already paid $75 at the doctor's office
RAJAT KASHYAP: I understand I was supposed to pay only $51.81
RAJAT KASHYAP: so i am very confused
RAJAT KASHYAP: I have already paid more than I was supposed to pay.. even then I am being asked for $51.81
RAJAT KASHYAP: can you pls. clear this
Liz M.: Sure, Rajat.
Liz M.: Rajat, as per our records, I do see the claim, the allowed amount was $51.81 which was applied towards your deductible which is your responsibility.
RAJAT KASHYAP: I have a reciept of the $75 payment I made
RAJAT KASHYAP: It was charged $75... without any plan discount. I guess with discounts it was $51.81, but I paid the full amount
Liz M.: Yes, you are correct. Your provider has taken the charged amount without any discount.
Liz M.: Rajat, you can contact to your provider and show them the explanation of benefit on that your responsibility is there.
RAJAT KASHYAP: so what should I do now? also why does it say that I still owe $51.81
Liz M.: You do not owe anything, your provider will refund you the extra amount that they charged.
RAJAT KASHYAP: I was asking why my account at UHC says that I oew 51.81
RAJAT KASHYAP: and what about the amounts $9.50, $36.12 and $12.54
Liz M.: I really understand your concern and value of money.
Liz M.: What best I can do for you, I will arrange a call back to your provider on behalf of you to your provider to resolve this.
RAJAT KASHYAP: sure, lets do that
RAJAT KASHYAP: My no is 646-407-6924
RAJAT KASHYAP: I just went for an yearly physical exam
Liz M.: May I have the date of service for the amount $9.50, $36.12 and $12.54 ?

RAJAT KASHYAP: Hi Freddie, are you still with me?
Freddy S.: Yes, I am here, Rajat.
RAJAT KASHYAP: Freddy*
Freddy S.: I was verifying your claim.
RAJAT KASHYAP: thank you
Freddy S.: You are welcome.
Freddy S.: Rajat, After a careful review on the claim of date of service 01/06/2017 for the charge amount $75 is applied towards your deductible.
Freddy S.: I see that the procedure code bill by your provider was not preventive. Hence, the code bill was applied towards your deductible.
RAJAT KASHYAP: ok, for that date, I was asked to come over for a follow-up after the physical... I understand this is not preventive
Freddy S.: Rajat, what best I can do is arrange an outreach to your provider and get this done.
RAJAT KASHYAP: but I was supposed to pay 51.81, I paid 75
Freddy S.: We will call your provider and ask them to refund your amount.
RAJAT KASHYAP: even after that, I still see at UHC website that I owe 51.81
RAJAT KASHYAP: I dont know for what?
RAJAT KASHYAP: and what about other charges
Freddy S.: Please be rest assure, I can understand that.
Freddy S.: I will take care of this issue.
RAJAT KASHYAP: thank you
Freddy S.: You are welcome, Rajat.
Freddy S.: We will get back to you with the positive outcome, once we hear from your provider.
RAJAT KASHYAP: also. there are charges of amounts $9.50, $36.12 and $12.54
RAJAT KASHYAP: this is related to my Physical exam, I want to know why I am being charged for this when my physical is fully covered
RAJAT KASHYAP: for service date 12/30
Freddy S.: Yes, again the codes bill by your provider was not preventive.
Freddy S.: I will document this as well in our records, and update you once we get in touch with them.
RAJAT KASHYAP: sure, thanks
RAJAT KASHYAP: one point here, I specifically asked whatever tests they are doing are included in physical and they said yes
Freddy S.: You are welcome, again. We will get this done.
Freddy S.: You may expect a call soon from United Healthcare with the outcome.
RAJAT KASHYAP: thank you so much

RAJAT KASHYAP: anytime during the day
RAJAT KASHYAP: just one last thing, for the claim on service date 01/06/2017... why does UHC says that I still owe the money to UHC?
Freddy S.: I documented every information, Is there anything else I may help you with today?
Freddy S.: As it was not updated yet that you paid to the provider.
RAJAT KASHYAP: ok, got it
RAJAT KASHYAP: How do I get it updated?
